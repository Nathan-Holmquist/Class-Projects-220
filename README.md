This was a project for my CPSC 220 class where we had to make a custom project using some parameters
I decided to create a casino roulette game.
It asks you for an amount of starting chips and then lets you gamble them with the same rules as traditional roulette
The only difference is that you can only bet one one thing per game. In traditional roulette you can bet on red, 23, and 0 all at the same time.
